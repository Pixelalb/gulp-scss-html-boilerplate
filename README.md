Gulp SCSS boilerplate for static templates
==========================================

Remember to run `npm install` command after cloning this repo ;) 

Then:

* run  `gulp` to start the project in DEV mode (w/ watchers, browsersync, etc..)
* run  `gulp build` to build the project for production (w/ compressed assets, etc..). Uses rsync. Make sure you change the deploy path on your server.
